# Team best practices

A compilation of agreed-on ways of working as a team

## Common things

Daily Scrum held every weekday at 12:30 (during the third period) either on Discord, at campus (eg. DK107, Factory, an empty classroom) or a mix of these. In the fourth period, the dailies are held at 14:00 except for Wednesdays when they are held at 12:30. The timing may change based on the team's needs.

Monday and Thursday are campus days, on which everyone will be present in the same space at least for the Daily. 

Asking questions and helping others is encouraged!

Let your teammates know if you're late or can't attend a meeting.

No working while sick!


## User stories and workflow

Product- and sprint backlog are documented in the Projects-section in Github under the organization FarmasiaVR.

Our workflow for tasks (or stories) in-sprint is as follows:

| Status      | Description                                                                                                                         | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Note                                                                                                                           |

| New         | Task has been created, refined and pulled into sprint.  Task has acceptance criteria and is ready for team to start working on.     | _tbd - how do we do sprint planning. Who pulls the stories into sprint? We don't have a product owner?_                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                |
| In progress | Work on the task is ongoing.                                                                                                        | When beginning work, **team member(s) working on the task**  change the status to In progress and mark themselves in the Assignees-column.                                                                            |                                                                                                                                |
| Review      | For tasks that need review (everything including coding,  and other tasks if team finds it important). Other tasks skip this state. | When task is ready for review, **team member(s) working on it**  move it to this state and put NEED REVIEW in the Review-column. The **reviewer** adds themself to the Review-column when they begin the review.  |                                                                                                                                |
| Ready       | Acceptance criteria for the task have been met.  Task is ready to be reviewed with the customer.                                    | **Team member(s) who did the work** move the task to this state  when either the work or the review is done.                                                                                                          | It is possible that the task goes back to basically any status,  if the customer does not accept the work done in the task.    |
| Done        | Task has been accepted by the customer.                                                                                             | _tbd - this is kinda product owner's thing to do_                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                |

The **Scrum master** may also change statuses etc for tasks during Daily, if needed.
