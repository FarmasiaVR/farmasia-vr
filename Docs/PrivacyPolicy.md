Reason for using user information: Inside the application, the user has the possibility of submitting their game report to their teacher at the University of Helsinki. To identify which student's report is in question, the user is asked for their email address. This information is then included in the report sent to the teacher. This information is not kept by FarmasiaVR after sending the report to the teacher. All logs of server activity are routinely removed. Information is not saved persistently to the application, nor the server or any other instance to which this app extends to. The user may choose to not use this function, and outside of the report functionality, no information about the user is collected or processed.

Security: User information (email address) has been appropriately secured in the application, and all communications take place over HTTPS encryption. The information is handled in Finland and will not be handed outside of the EU.
