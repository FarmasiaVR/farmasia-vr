So let's say that several people have modified the same scene in Unity. One person wanted a cube to be really **L O O O O O O N G** and someone instead made the cube very large. Now there's a merge conflict and you're worried that you're going to lose the entire scene. No worries, here's a guide on how to solve merge conflicts

Example of a scenario that would cause a merge conflict

## How to solve merge conflict using Visual Studio Code

1. Open up Visual Studio Code
2. Open the project's root folder.
3. From the leftside bar choose "Source Control"
4. From "Merge Changes" select a file with merge conflicts

5. From the lower right corner select "Resolve in Merge Editor"

6. Now you will see three different windows. The upper-left window shows the contents of the file that currently resides in the repository. The upper-right window shows the contents of the file that is currently on your computer. The lower window shows the resulting file content. You can select which changes to keep by selecting "Accept Incoming" or "Accept Current" on every change. The rows should give a clue as to which parts of the scene are clashing. **Just make sure not to accept both incoming and current changes.** I have no idea what that would do, but I don't think it would be pretty :DD

7. After you have gone through all the conflicts, click "Complete Merge" in the lower-right corner.

8. Make sure that the merge conflict is solved by opening the asset in Unity. If it opens and functions, then the merge conflict is solved and you can go on about your day. Remember to stay hydrated and use a seatbelt when driving! :shipit:

## More complicated merge conflicts

For more in-depth merging, you should use the UnityYAMLMerge ("Unity Smart Merge") tool. Read up on it [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SmartMerge.html). Follow the Git steps to add the required lines to your `$HOME/.gitconfig`. You will also need to configure UnityYAMLMerge using the `mergespecfile.txt`, as guided on [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63005559). You will also need a merge tool, such as [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) installed. For Windows, make sure to specify Meld's binary as `MeldConsole.exe`.

Once you are in the merge conflict phase, simply run `git mergetool` to run UnityYAMLMerge, which will then subsequently run Meld for when it needs your opinion on things. Be sure to also check out [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34119867) on using Meld and `git mergetool` in general. Have fun ü§ûüìù
