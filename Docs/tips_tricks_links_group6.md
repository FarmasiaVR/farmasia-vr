[Meta Horizon dashboard](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/641878557790712/?app=6038104376288741) The website where you can manage builds and check testing status.

[Unity](https://unity.com/), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) & most other dev tools work on PC, Mac or Linux. But [Meta Quest Link app](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/install-app-for-link/?srsltid=AfmBOorM4kNt9xiuJPnsbwMDC-6-vOahgObNBf4eRSMXh98UkVTdVZvi) is for **PC only**. So if you want to test the game "on the fly" while developing in Unity you have to connect the headset to a PC.\
During customer meetings it was much easier to have the headset connected with a cable to a PC laptop running unity. The gameplay is smoother and you can make adjustmets to the game instantly without making a build and updating it to the headset.
