      The game starts in the clean room equipment
      preparation room.


      On a table in the room, there''s a list of equipment
      needed in the clean room. Settling plates are soy-casein (1 piece) and sabouraud-dextrose
      (1 piece). Fingertip plates are soy-casein plates (2 pieces).


      Find
      the necessary equipment in the preparation room and transfer them to the pass-through
      cabinet, spraying the equipment with ethanol. After that, go to the clean room.


      In
      the clean room, transfer the equipment from the pass-through cabinet to the
      LAF (Laminar Air Flow) cabinet. Make the necessary markings on the bottles:
      date, player, and the name of the nutrient medium (thioglycollate or soy-casein).


      Make
      the necessary markings on the bottoms of the settling and fingertip plates.

      Settling
      plates: player, date, and time.

      Fingertip plates: player, date, and
      left/right hand.


      Place the settling plates, still closed, in the selected
      sampling points. Open the settling plates and leave the lids leaning against
      the edge so that the entire nutrient surface is open.


      Prepare 2 x 80
      ml of both, soy-casein and thioglycollate media, by pipetting the nutrients
      into sterile bottles.'

      The game starts in the clean room equipment
      preparation room.


      On a table in the room, there''s a list of equipment
      needed in the clean room. In the aseptic area, bevacizumab eye drops are prepared.


      Find
      the necessary equipment in the preparation room and transfer them to the pass-through
      cabinet. After that, go to the clean room.


      In the clean room, transfer
      the equipment from the pass-through cabinet to the LAF (Laminar Air Flow) cabinet.


      Dose
      the drug preparation using a 20 ml syringe and luer lock into 1 ml syringes.
      Dose 0.15 ml of the drug preparation per syringe. Remember to follow aseptic
      working principles.


      Seal the 1 ml syringes with caps and pack in a
      sterilization bag.


      At the end of the task, remember to clean the LAF
      cabinet of tools.


      The game ends when you return to the equipment preparation
      room.'

      Attach
      the membrane filter to the pump. Moisten the membrane with 1 ml of moistening
      solution (peptone water) and start the pump. Once the peptone water has been
      filtered, shut off the pump.


      Transfer 0.15 ml of the drug preparation
      from the syringe to the membrane filter and start the pump. Once the entire
      volume has been filtered, shut off the pump.


      Remove the top part of
      the filter and slice the membrane with a scalpel.


      Using tweezers, transfer
      half of the membrane to the soy-casein medium and the other half to the thioglycollate
      medium. From each medium, one bottle remains as a control that doesn''t contain
      a membrane.


      After working, close the settling plates and note down
      the end time.


      Lift the lid of the fingertip plate with the untested
      hand and gently press the fingers of the hand to be tested against the nutrient
      surface for about 5 seconds, taking care not to break the agar surface (first,
      samples from the index finger to the little finger on the top part of the plate,
      then from the thumb to the center of the plate); finally, close the plate.


      Repeat
      the fingertip plate sampling for the other hand.


      At the end of the
      task, remember to clean the LAF cabinet of tools.'
