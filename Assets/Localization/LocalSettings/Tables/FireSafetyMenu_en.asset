      You can light the fire

      by pressing
      the red button.

      fire hose reel

      to put out the fire.'

      1: Take the fire extinguisher
      from the wall holder/bracket and move closer to the fire.


      2: Put the
      bottle on the ground and release the hose from its holder.


      3: Remove
      the safety pin of the upper handle with a sharp jerk, when doing this you should
      not press on the handle as it will make it difficult to release the pin.


      4:
      Lift the extinguisher from the bottom handle and grab the hose by the nozzle.


      5:
      Aim at the fire target and aim the nozzle of the hose at the base of the flames.


      6:
      Push the upper handle of the fire extinguisher all the way down.


      7:
      Approach the burning object and apply the extinguishing agent to the burning
      object by making a waving, sweeping motion with the nozzle.


      8: When
      the flames go out, raise the top handle and observe. If the fire starts again,
      repeat the extinguishing operation. By periodically extinguishing, you save
      extinguishing agent and can put out comparatively larger fires.'

    m_Localized: 'At the time this game was made, the hand held fire extinguishers
      in the laboratory were all liquid/foam fire extinguishers. The extinguishing
      agent of liquid-based fire extinguishers is either liquid or liquid-based foam.
      They are suitable for extinguishing liquid and solid substances. Most liquid
      fire extinguishers are also suitable for extinguishing electrical fires. Check
      the safety distances on the user manual label. The advantage of liquid fire
      extinguishers is easier post-cleaning than when using powder fire extinguishers.


      A
      foam and liquid extinguisher can be used to effectively extinguish the fire
      from 0.5 to 1.5 meters away.'

      1. Open the protective cabinet.


      2.
      Disassemble and spread the hose on the floor


      (the pressurized hose
      is more difficult to pull out of the hose).


      3. Open the shut-off valve.

    m_Localized: 'The fire hose reel is an initial extinguishing device permanently
      placed on the wall of buildings, in a protective cabinet. The fire hose reel
      is connected to the property''s water mains. The fire hose reel includes a
      manually opened shut-off valve, a hose, a coil and a spray tube. The advantage
      of the fire hose reel is that there is enough extinguishing agent as long as
      the property''s water supply is working.

      The extinguishing effect of
      the fire hose reel is cooling and it is well suited to most solid substance
      fires. Water must not be used to turn off high-voltage electrical equipment.
      The fire hose reel must also not be used on fires involving liquid substances
      or grease fires.'

      1. Pull out the cover from the two strips
      and spread it wide open



      2. Hold the straps or grab the corners of
      the blanket and protect your hands behind the blanket



      3. When you
      are near a fire, stretch your hands straight ahead, you will get a protective
      shield from fire and smoke



      4. Get as close as possible to the burning
      object



      5. Spread the cover over the fire and back off, always leave
      the cover in place



      6. Continue extinguishing with other fire extinguishers
      and equipment, if necessary



      If a person or his clothes are on fire:



      1.
      Order or attempt to knock the victim to the ground



      2. Use the blanket
      and approach the person from the side or from the shoulder-head line and place
      the blanket over the victim



      3. Leave the person''s head outside the
      blanket, first protect the respiratory organs by sealing the neck area well
      with the blanket and continue sealing from the upper body, down along the side
      line.



      4. Call 112, give immediate first aid.



      5. Cool with
      water if possible.'

    m_Localized: 'The fire blanket is an easy-to-use (with practice) and inexpensive
      extinguishing equipment for home and leisure and teaching laboratories. The
      cover is made of fiberglass-reinforced fabric, which can withstand heat of
      several hundred degrees momentarily. Its extinguishing effect is suffocating.
      In an extinguishing situation, it is important that you can protect yourself
      and properly cover the object to be extinguished.



      The fire blanket
      is excellently suited for electrical equipment fires and small liquid pool
      fires. It is also one of the best extinguishing agents if a person''s clothing
      catches fire. It is worth practicing using the fire blanket (this game itself
      does not give the user actual hand skills regarding the fire blanket).'
