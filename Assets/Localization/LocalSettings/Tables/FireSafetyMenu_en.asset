      You can light the fire

      by pressing
      the red button.

      You can use the

      hand fire extinguisher or

      fire hose reel

      to put out the fire.'

    m_Localized: 'Using the fire extinguisher:


      1: Take the fire extinguisher
      from the wall holder/bracket and move closer to the fire.


      2: Put the
      bottle on the ground and release the hose from its holder.


      3: Remove
      the safety pin of the upper handle with a sharp jerk, when doing this you should
      not press on the handle as it will make it difficult to release the pin.


      4:
      Lift the extinguisher from the bottom handle and grab the hose by the nozzle.


      5:
      Aim at the fire target and aim the nozzle of the hose at the base of the flames.


      6:
      Push the upper handle of the fire extinguisher all the way down.


      7:
      Approach the burning object and apply the extinguishing agent to the burning
      object by making a waving, sweeping motion with the nozzle.


      8: When
      the flames go out, raise the top handle and observe. If the fire starts again,
      repeat the extinguishing operation. By periodically extinguishing, you save
      extinguishing agent and can put out comparatively larger fires.'

    m_Localized: 'At the time this game was made, the hand held fire extinguishers
      in the laboratory were all liquid/foam fire extinguishers. The extinguishing
      agent of liquid-based fire extinguishers is either liquid or liquid-based foam.
      They are suitable for extinguishing liquid and solid substances. Most liquid
      fire extinguishers are also suitable for extinguishing electrical fires. Check
      the safety distances on the user manual label. The advantage of liquid fire
      extinguishers is easier post-cleaning than when using powder fire extinguishers.


      A
      foam and liquid extinguisher can be used to effectively extinguish the fire
      from 0.5 to 1.5 meters away.'
